## PelviX Treatment Overview

### What is PelviX?

PelviX is a medical-grade training chair that uses magnetic pulses (Functional Magnetic Stimulation - FMS) to activate, train, and strengthen the entire pelvic floor region.

- Completely painless
- Non-invasive (no devices inserted into the body)
- Suitable for both women and men of all ages
- Session duration: 22-30 minutes

### Treatment Benefits
